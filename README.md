# js_assignment

Created a function that returns two numbers from an array such that they add up to target. Assuming each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

## Solutions Explanation
- I used a for loop within a for loop to iterate over the array values at different positions.
- Summed the values to match with the target
- and return the value from the first loop and second loop that that that sums to the target
